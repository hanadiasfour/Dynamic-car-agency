# Dynamic Car Agency Project

## Description
A car agency application featuring an intricate data structure. This project contains double linked lists which categorize cars by brand, and single linked lists to organize available cars, all of which are sorted alphabetically and by year. Customer orders are processed through a Queue, and sold cars find a place in a Stack.

**Main Features:**
- Read and save car and order data from and to files.
- Clients can navigate brands, filter car options, and place orders.
- Admin operations involve managing the car inventory, processing customer orders, and maintaining a record of the last 10 sold cars.
- Provides a hands-on and efficient user experience with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using JavaFX.
